### Braising

Braised dishes are similar to [roasts](../blob/master/entrees/roasts.md) in that their format begins with high heat then low heat, but the key difference is the presence of a flavorful wet liquid.

The presence of that liquid, such as broth, beer, wine, or juice keeps the maximum temperature of the meat low for a long period of time, allowing collagen to gelatinize and meat to become tender, while also transferring the flavor of the liquid into the meat.

Usually, tough cuts of meat with lots of connective tissue are cooked this way, it is unusual to do this with vegetables or lean cuts.

### Preparation Steps

1. Apply a flavorful rub to the meat. Sometimes it is desirable to cut the meat into smaller pieces or coat the meat in flour to thicken the sauce.
2. Sear the meat over medium to high heat. It is usually desirable to do this in the same vessel where the meat will simmer, such as in a pressure cooker in saute mode, a dutch oven, or high walled roasting pan. If a traditional slow cooker is being used, sear the meat in a separate pan and transfer it to the long cooking vessel.
3. Saute cleaned, trimmed, and chopped aromatics such as aliums, peppers, celery, carrots, ginger, or fennel. As before, this is best done in the long cooking vessel such as the dutch oven, but this requires reserving the meat to a plate or something while you sweat the vegetables.
4. Deglaze the searing vessel with flavorful liquid, such as stock or alcohol; but water is fine. Scrape the bottom of the pot thoroughly to release the fond from the bottom and reduce likelihood of burning.
5. Put seared meat, sauteed vegetables, any additional vegetables, and flavorful liquid into the [dutch oven, slow cooker, pressure cooker] and simmer covered on low heat for a long time. A dutch oven in an oven set to 300F/150C for 3 hours, a slow cooker on "low" for 8 hours or "high" for 6, a pressure cooker for 1 hour on high pressure, or over a stovetop burner on low flame for 3 hours.
6. The dish is done when the meat can be pulled apart easily with forks. Serve with broth over starches (grits, mashed potatoes, rice) and with any desired vegetables for a filling and balanced meal.
