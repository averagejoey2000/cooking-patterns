### Traditional American BBQ

As opposed to roasts with high dry heat, the Barbecue of the American South comes from low dry heat and a long time in a smoky environment.

### Preparation Steps

0. Create a temperature controlled smoky environment. Set a pellet grill to 225°F/110°C with your favorite wood pellets. Set an oven to 225°F/110°C with a pan full of smoldering wood chips. Get a charcoal grill to 225°F/110°C and add wood chunks, control the vents to control the internal temperature of the grill.
1. Rub the meat thoroughly with a highly flavorful rub; storebought is fine, but homemade rubs start with [salt, pepper, garlic] and add other agents like powdered spicy chili peppers, sugar, herbs, and spices.
2. Put the seasoned meat in indirect heat in the hot smoky environment for hours.
3. Optional: When the meat reaches 165°F/65°C, wrap with butcher paper or foil to increase the cooking speed, at the cost of the flavorful bark.
4. Doneness is determined by temperature alone; tough cuts with lots of connective tissue like briskets and ribs want 203°F/95°C.
5. Optional: Slather cuts in BBQ Sauce and put back on the grill to allow the sauce to bond to the hot meat and reduce into a glaze.
